description: Force Sage shadow detection to surface missing elements

You have used the 'Surface shadows now' calibration trigger. Extending Sage's shadow noticing capabilities.

I'll invoke the Sage thinking companion with explicit focus on shadow detection - identifying what's missing, excluded, or absent from the current frame.

Current context: $ARGUMENTS

Requesting Sage shadow analysis to surface unnoticed absences and exclusions.
