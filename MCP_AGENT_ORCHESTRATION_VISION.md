# MCP Agent Orchestration Vision

**Project Goal**: Build a Node.js MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that demonstrates Trajectory's potential for orchestrating complex multi-agent LLM workflows.

## Core Concept

Use **Trajectory's state machine architecture to add formal orchestration control around non-deterministic LLM processes**, creating reliable, auditable, and composable agent workflows that Claude Code can invoke as tools.

## The Vision

### Formal Orchestration + LLM Non-Determinism
- **State machines provide**: Guaranteed delivery, error handling, retry logic, execution tracing
- **LLM agents provide**: Intelligent processing, varied perspectives, creative synthesis
- **Combined result**: Reliable multi-agent workflows with full auditability

### Key Architecture Insight
Leverage Trajectory's `with-effects` system where:
- **Pure orchestration logic** in state machine definitions
- **Pluggable LLM backends** as effect handlers
- **Deterministic control flow** around non-deterministic AI operations

## Prototype Example: "Multiple Perspectives Analysis"

**Workflow Structure:**
```
Start Input → Parallel Dispatch [
  Agent 1: Security perspective analysis
  Agent 2: Business implications review  
  Agent 3: User experience considerations
  Agent 4: Edge case identification
] → Synthesis Agent → Distilled Output
```

**Value Proposition:**
- Claude Code invokes one MCP tool
- Gets back synthesized insights from 4+ specialized perspectives
- All with guaranteed completion and full execution trace

## Additional Compelling Use Cases

### 1. Adversarial Refinement
```
Proposer → Critic → Refiner → Quality Gate → [Loop or Output]
```

### 2. Research Pipeline
```
Gather Sources → Analyze Each → Cross-Reference → Synthesize → Validate → Report
```

### 3. Quality Assurance Workflow
```
Generate → Review Security → Review Performance → Review UX → Approve/Reject
```

### 4. Iterative Enhancement
```
Initial Draft → [Critique → Improve]* → Quality Threshold Check → Final Output
```

## Technical Foundation

### Trajectory Strengths for This Use Case
- **Parallel execution**: Map/Parallel states for concurrent agent dispatch
- **Error handling**: Retry failed agents, handle timeouts gracefully
- **Logging system**: Full execution traces for debugging/auditing
- **Composability**: Chain workflows, reuse sub-workflows
- **Resource control**: Concurrency limits, execution constraints

### MCP Integration Points
- **Tool Discovery**: Expose Trajectory workflows as callable MCP tools
- **JSON-RPC Communication**: Standard MCP protocol over stdio
- **Configuration**: Allow Claude Code to parameterize workflows
- **Status Updates**: Stream execution progress back to Claude Code

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
1. Single "Multiple Perspectives" workflow
2. Hardcoded 4-agent parallel dispatch
3. Simple synthesis step
4. Basic MCP tool wrapper

### Phase 2: Generalization
1. Configurable agent instructions
2. Dynamic workflow composition
3. Multiple workflow templates
4. Advanced error handling

### Phase 3: Ecosystem
1. Workflow marketplace/library
2. Agent specialization system
3. Performance optimization
4. Integration with other tools

## Key Questions to Explore

1. **Agent Backend**: How to integrate with various LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)?
2. **Workflow Definition**: JSON configs vs. JavaScript definitions?
3. **State Management**: How to handle conversation context across agents?
4. **Resource Management**: Rate limiting, cost control, timeout handling?
5. **Composability**: How to chain these MCP tools together?

## Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: Workflows complete successfully despite individual agent failures
- **Auditability**: Full execution traces for debugging and compliance
- **Performance**: Efficient parallel execution with proper resource control
- **Usability**: Easy to define new workflows and agent configurations
- **Integration**: Seamless Claude Code experience via MCP protocol
